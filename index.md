<ins>*Programming*</ins>\
I learned a lot from taking classes here at UCSD. Classes like CSE 11 and 12 taught me to program in Java, while labs like CSE 15L taught me skills like using `ls` and `vim`.
Programming languages I have learned include:
- Python
- Java
- C
- C++
- Assembly
> C was my personal favorite.\
